# PROJECT-1
This project is a web application built with Streamlit designed to streamline the data preparation process for Power BI. It allows users to upload an Excel spreadsheet, interactively select the desired columns, and apply automated cleaning and standardization routines. The final output is a clean CSV file, ready for easy ingestion into Power BI.
